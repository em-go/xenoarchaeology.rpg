## Storyline

You are the expert archaeologist on a team of intergalactic travelers employed by your home planet's megacorp. Your team is tasked with exploring new planets and making megacorp more money. The political parties in power back at home planet mandated that all intergalactic traveling teams must include at least one archaeologist to satisfy historical empathy requirements. Other members on your team want to just blast shit and collect the rubble, but you have pride in your work and want to study any remaining artifacts from cultures that have existed before. There is conflict on the team because of this. 

The intergalactic travelers arrive at the third planet of a remote solar system and immediately the other team members just want to break shit and walk away, but you convince them to let you investigate some locations the probes picked up when they were scanning the planets surface layers before you arrived.

Archaeological expeditions allow you to find and study artefacts left behind by the population that once inhabited this planet. Any artefacts or remains found will be added to the history log of this planet. The history log gets uploaded into the intergalactic server which all citizens have access to. You are fully responsible for documenting the entire history of this planet before it is completely destroid and razed for resources. Everything you find becomes the history, so this can get pretty weird if you only document some things.

Player has the ability to fully customize their character, oh yeah they aren't human so they could be whatever weird alien thing they want.
